      "[\"Lucky Dog: I loved this book! Wendy Taylor Carlisle's poems are beautiful, true and deeply moving. Every word seems well-chosen, and nothing's extra. I love the sense the poems give of a real person behind the words--a smart, funny, heartful woman looking unblinkingly at herself and the world, and bravely telling what she sees. I love that the poems aren't afraid to speak in their own voice or to talk about things that matter. I admire Wendy Carlisle's use of form, which is so masterful it seems effortless. I'd recommend this book to both poetry lovers and people who've never read poetry before--the poems here are so inviting, and worth reading and re-reading.\\\\n\"]\n",
